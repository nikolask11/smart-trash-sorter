# smart-trash-sorter
This project  uses AI to classify trash between recyclable and not recyclable.

Hi everyone. I'm going to be attempting to create a trash sorter over the next couple of weeks. Feel free to join and tell me if I'm doing something incorrectly.

### Tuesday 15th July 2025 Progress Report:
I have come to the realization that, I will probably need to collect my own data. All datasets that I have found have restrictive licences that mean that I can't really open source share them here on GitHub. I also cannot share any demonstrations of the code I create. Therefore, I will spend some time collecting pictures of trash, and I will come back here.

### Wednesday 16 July 2025 Progress Report:
I have decided to collect pictures of the different types of plastic, because, there is already a wide variety of generic trash datasets, but no sorted plastic datasets, that I could find. So I will collect pictures using an old phone I have and put them on my computer and label them. Then I will upload the dataset to GitHub.
